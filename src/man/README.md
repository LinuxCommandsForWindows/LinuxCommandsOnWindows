# man

This directory contains the source code of `man`, a port of the reference manual command to Windows.

The manual pages are stored as files; in which they needed to be extracted to the **top-level** of
the drive the `man` executable is located in.

So, if the `man` executable is located in the `D:` drive (the folder does not matter), then the manual
page files are to be stored at `D:\shared\man`.
