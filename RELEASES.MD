# Linux Commands for Windows 0.1.1 (01-06-2021)

The second release after the initial release!

Only the target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is supported for the commands as of now.

## Added Commands

### [`whoami` 0.1.0](https://github.com/LinuxCommandsForWindows/LinuxCommandsOnWindows/tree/main/src/whoami)

`whoami` is the `whoami` command from Linux ported over to Windows.

Even though it already exists for Windows, I still think it'd be a great addition to the collection
to feel more like a Linux-ish guy before making my final transition to Linux.

You should rename the executable file to `whoami` before adding it to the environment variables or adding it to
your PowerShell profile - if you're using PowerShell; so that you don't have to type `whoami-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
when you want to use `whoami`!

# Linux Commands for Windows 0.1.0 (31-05-2021)

The initial release!

Only the target `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is supported for the commands as of now.

## Added Commands

### [`winfetch` 0.1.0](https://github.com/LinuxCommandsForWindows/LinuxCommandsOnWindows/tree/main/src/winfetch)

`winfetch` is a `neofetch`-like command line utility, but ported over to Windows; therefore named as `winfetch`!

This release of `winfetch` is the initial release. It has all the basic functionality to function properly.

You should rename the executable file to `winfetch` before adding it to the environment variables or adding it to
your PowerShell profile - if you're using PowerShell; so that you don't have to type `winfetch-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
when you want to use `winfetch`!
